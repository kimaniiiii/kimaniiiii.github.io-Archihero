Design System

Color Palette
Primary: Deep Navy (#0A2463) - Represents professionalism and trust

Secondary: Terracotta (#D36135) - Warm accent color inspired by natural materials

Neutrals:
  - Light Sand (#F7F7F2) - Clean background
  - Medium Gray (#6E7E85) - Text and secondary elements

Accent: Sage Green (#5C946E) - Reflects our sustainable design philosophy

*Rationale*: The palette balances architectural seriousness (navy) with creative warmth (terracotta), while sage green emphasizes our commitment to sustainable design.

## Responsive Breakpoints

### Layout Logic
- **SM (≤768px)**: 
  - Single column layout
  - Stacked navigation
  - Simplified FAQ accordions
- **MD (769px-1024px)**: 
  - 2-column grid for service sections
  - Side-by-side contact form and info
  - Tabbed navigation
- **LG (≥1025px)**: 
  - Full 3-column service grid
  - Expanded hero with background video
  - Persistent sidebar navigation

## Creative Divergences

1. **Interactive Elements**:
   - Added hover animations on service cards
   - Implemented smooth scrolling for anchor links
   - Enhanced FAQ section with animated accordions

2. **Navigation**:
   - Created a sticky header with progressive enhancement
   - Added a "Get Started" floating CTA on mobile

3. **Visual Hierarchy**:
   - Incorporated subtle architectural line patterns in section dividers
   - Used dynamic gradient overlays on hero images

4. **Content Presentation**:
   - Developed a testimonial carousel instead of static quotes
   - Added a project timeline visualization for the "How It Works" section
